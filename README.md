- 👋 Hi, I’m @jorge-mells
- 👀 I’m interested in maths and programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript(technically, I'm just reading javascript books, so yeah)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet
- 📫 You can reach me by email: jorgemelloes@gmail.com
- 💻 I've currently used a bit of OCaml, Python, Java, Assembly, C, Kotlin, JavaScript, and Scala(but I'm still a beginner in all of them)

<!--- 
More about me, for those interested
- I'm a generalist
- I have only used MIPS and RISC V
- In the future, I plan to learn and make C++ my working language. It is low level enough and offers high level features like OOP, hence I think it 
  is the language for me.
